<h1  style="padding-left:20px;"></span>FAQ<i>s</i></h1>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">Here are some question you might have in your mind.</p>
		<div id="accordion">
				  <h3>Q. What is online booking and how do I use it?</h3>
				  <div>
				 
				<p>A. Online booking is a convenient way of booking your travel over the internet. Using the Air India online services, you can:</p>
				<ul>
						<li>Book a flight and pay online for your travel
						<li>Request for a particular seat, special meal or service
						<li>Check Flight status
						<li>View the Schedule/timetable
						<li>Redeem your frequent flyer miles online
						<li>Web Check in
				</ul><p>On the new website, you have a display of benefits related to the cabin, thus enabling you to take a decision to pay more and get additional benefits in the same cabin. You can also block a seat of your choice at the time of booking.</p>
					
				  </div>
				  <h3>Q. How do I check flight status?</h3>
				  <div>
					<p>
				   A. 
				There is a link on the SEC home page for viewing Flight Status.
					</p>
				  </div>
				  <h3>Q. How do I rebook or cancel bookings made online on the Air India website?</h3>
				  <div>
					<p>
					A.<p style="padding-left:20px;">
				Once you make your reservation online you can make use of the "My Booking" section to cancel your reservation for only fully unutilized tickets. The link to the "My Booking" section can be accessed from the homepage of the Air India website www.airindia.in.

				The modification/cancellation request for bookings made online will be processed automatically through the Internet Booking Engine. Any refund due will be done through the system in accordance with the applicable modification/cancellation rules. Any refund due will be done through the system in accordance with the applicable cancellation rules.

				However, as we are still in a transition process, for modification of bookings made on the new website, you may please contact the call centre or nearest Air India booking office

				Further cancellation of a single PNR that have multiple passengers booked on it, will result in cancellation of all the booked passengers and is not possible to cancel one passenger from a multi- passenger booking. You would have to contact the call centre for such cancelations or rebooking.

				Kindly send an email to ecommerce@airindia.in in the following circumstances:

				If you are unable to access the "My Booking" section due to an error or if the fare rule does not permit the refund or in case of involuntary refunds/modifications
				For any online booking clarifications/queries/ non receipt of refund.
				Refund against tickets purchased through credit/debit cards will be only in accordance with credit/debit card refund procedures. Please note that cancellation and refund rules differ for different fare types and the same are displayed in the 'View Fare Rules' link on the Flight and Fare Options page of the Select tab.

				If the booking has not been made online, please contact any AIR INDIA office to make changes or cancel your reservation. Tickets will be refunded by the ticket issuing office only. The refund of a ticket issued by a Travel Agent will be processed by the issuing Travel Agent only.

				Note: Passengers holding open tickets (issued across Air India counters/travel agents) should contact the nearest Air India office/travel agent for endorsing the tickets for travel. Bookings cannot be made online using existing open tickets.

				These charges are included in the charges displayed to you in the rebooking/cancellation policy displayed in the View fare rules.</p>

				<li>Such infant/child below 5 years must be accompanied by an additional Hostess.

				  <div>

				  </div>
				   <h3>Q.Can I use more than one card for my payment if I have a credit limit on my card?</h3>
				  <div>

				  </div>
				   <h3>Q.Is it secure to give my personal details and my Credit card information online?
				</h3>
				  <div>
					<p>A.
				Our site www.airindia.in uses the industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt all personal data that is sent by your computer to the Air India server. Please see our Terms and Conditions for details.</p>
				  </div>
					<h3>Q.How do I know that the connection is secure?</h3>
				  <div>
					<p>A.
				The closed lock on the bottom of the browser is an indication that the page is secure. You may also view the same, using the browser security options in the tools/ properties depending on the browser you are using.</p>
				  </div>
				   <h3>Q. How can the fare displayed on the currency converter be different from the amount charged by my bank?
				</h3>
				  <div>
					<p>
				A.
				While booking online on our website, fares will always be displayed in the currency of the country where your journey originates. Further, through the Payment Gateway, Air India would capture, process and receive payment for the exact amount as displayed on the ticket. Air India does not charge anything additional to the displayed fare. Our web site does offer the option of viewing the equivalent fare amount in the desired currency. However that is purely for reference purposes (as mentioned in the display box) and may not be the actual amount charged by your card issuer, since they use the applicable selling rate of the bank.</p>
				  </div>
				  <h3>Q.Why have I been charged a foreign transaction fee?
				</h3>
				  <div>
					<p>A.
				The closed lock on the bottom of the browser is an indication that the page is secure. You may also view the same, using the browser security options in the tools/ properties depending on the browser you are using.</p>
				  </div>
				  
				  <h3>Q.If I book my flights online, how will I get my tickets?
				</h3>
				  <div>

				After you complete your online purchase, the system will generate your itinerary receipt vide email and display the key information of about your reservation on the screen. You will need to print the receipt sent by email and produce it at the airport along with your valid photo identification for check-in. Please carry this printed receipt to gain access to the airport and to check-in.</p>
				  </div>
				   <h3>Q. I did not receive a booking confirmation on the page. What should I do?
				</h3>
				  <div>
					<p>
				A.
				You should have received a copy of the receipt at the email address you entered during the booking process. Please check that the email has not gone into your Junk Mail folder. You are required to print and carry this receipt to gain access to the airport and to check-in.</p>
